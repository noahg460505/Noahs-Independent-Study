# Daily Documentation
## Week 1
### Day 1 - 2026-01-29
Today I discussed my initial ideas with Mr. Small and how this independent study will actually work. I created this GitHub repository and began doing some planning, I created my initial [6-6-6 plan](./6-6-6-Plan.md).

## Week 2
### Day 2 - 2026-02-02
Today I worked on my GitHub repository more. I added an initial BOM to my [project proposal](./Project-Proposal.md) and created [Daily-Documentation.md](Daily-Documentation.md)

### Day 3 - 2026-02-04
Today I really didn't feel like working on the GitHub repo so I started on some [Python code](./Code/initial.py).

### Day 4 - 2026-02-06
I think my proposal is all ready, just need to find a specific thermal printer to buy. Today I mostly just worked on my Health 2 online stuff during class.

## Week 3
### Day 5 - 2026-02-10
Today I once again just worked on Health 2 online stuff while waiting for Mr. Small, he told me he was gonna look at the project proposal this weekend but he was busy, hopefully next class?

### Day 6 - 2026-02-12
Today I worked more on the Python code because I was tired
why do i only ever feel like doing code when im tired

Next class I think I'll start prototyping, assuming Mr. Small looks at my project proposal over the weekend.

## Week 4
### Day 7 - 2026-02-17
Today I talked to Mr. Small and discussed my project and ordering a thermal printer for the project. I also worked on the Python code a bit more.

### Day 8- 2026-02-19
Today I was pretty unproductive, I installed the Arduino IDE on my laptop to start working on the code for the Arduino end, didn't really do anything though :P
I'm tired, my birthday was yesterday, I stayed up kinda late
