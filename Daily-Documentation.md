# Daily Documentation
## Week 1
### Day 1 - 2026-01-29
Today I discussed my initial ideas with Mr. Small and how this independent study will actually work. I created this GitHub repository and began doing some planning, I created my initial [6-6-6 plan](./6-6-6-Plan.md).

## Week 2
### Day 2 - 2026-02-02
Today I worked on my GitHub repository more. I added an initial BOM to my [project proposal](./Project-Proposal.md) and created [Daily-Documentation.md](Daily-Documentation.md)

### Day 2 - 2026-02-04
Today I really didn't feel like working on the GitHub repo so I started on some [Python code](./Code/initial.py).
