# 6-6-6 Plan
Have a demonstratable project every six weeks. I need to have a plan for extending my project if I finish early.

## First six weeks:
### Week 1
- Create this GitHub repository and draft a 6-6-6 plan.

### Week 2
- Mr. Small is out this week, spend this week making a full project proposal, including a Bill of Materials.

### Week 3
- Show Mr. Small my project proposal and discuss the proposal with him.
- If my proposal is ready, begin prototyping and/or do preliminary CAD.

### Week 4
- Further prototyping and CAD work. Hopefully I'll have a screen and printer by this point for prototyping.

### Week 5
- More prototyping and more CAD

### Week 6
- Have a working proof-of-concept prototype for demonstration, can be a bit clunky and ugly.
- Draft plan for the next six weeks of my 6-6-6 plan.
- Write a reflection on how the project is going so far and where I plan to take it.

## Second six weeks:
### Week 7

### Week 8

### Week 9
