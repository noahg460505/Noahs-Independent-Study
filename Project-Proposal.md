# Project Proposal
## Goal:
My goal for this project is to make an interactive "Message Time Capsule" box that uses a Raspberry Pi to take input from a keyboard and print it via a thermal printer into a compartment in a box. The user inputs a time after they input their message for how long the message will stay in the box before the message compartment is ejected out of the box using a motor. Message input will be displayed as it is being typed, and the time until the message is released will also be displayed.
